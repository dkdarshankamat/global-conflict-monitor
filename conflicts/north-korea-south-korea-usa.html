      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-300 mb-2">Energy & Tech Impacts</h2>
      <p>
        The U.S. deployed EMP-resistant drones across South Korea while North Korea expanded its underground AI data centers in the northern mountains. Quantum jamming tech caused navigation chaos in civilian air corridors. South Korea diverted 30% of its energy budget to anti-drone and surveillance countermeasures by 2036.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-300 mb-2">Current Status Quo </h2>
      <p>
        The Korean peninsula remains militarized. North Korea is under semi-permanent international sanctions, relying on Russia and Iran for limited trade. The U.S. maintains 35,000 troops in South Korea, now supported by autonomous weapon networks. Tensions flare quarterly, with no significant diplomatic momentum.
