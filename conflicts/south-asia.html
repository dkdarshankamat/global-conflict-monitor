      <p>
        From 2025 to 2040, regional instability across South Asia — encompassing India, Pakistan, and China — led to an estimated <span class="text-red-500 font-semibold">75,000+</span> deaths. This includes border skirmishes, insurgent violence in Kashmir, drone warfare, and cyber provocations.

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
<li>1949: UN-mediated ceasefire ended First Kashmir War and established the Line of Control (LoC).</li>
<li>1972: Simla Agreement committed both to bilateral dialogue and peaceful resolution of disputes.</li>
<li>1993: Agreement on Peace and Tranquility along LAC began formal military protocols.</li>
<li>1999: Lahore Declaration promoted nuclear risk reduction; derailed by Kargil War the same year.</li>
<li>1996–2005: Confidence-building agreements focused on troop reduction and communication.</li>
<li>2003: LoC ceasefire agreement initiated relative calm until skirmishes resumed in later years.</li>
<li>2004–2008: Composite Dialogue Process covered Kashmir, trade, and terrorism; ended after 26/11 attacks.</li>
<li>2013: Border Defence Cooperation Agreement aimed at preventing face-offs</li>
<li>2020–2022 – Corps Commander-level talks held after Galwan clashes; partial disengagement in some sectors.</li>

        <li>2027: “Ladakh Corridor Agreement” attempted to de-militarize key sectors — later collapsed during a satellite shootdown incident in 2029.</li>
        <li>2030: SAARC emergency summit held but failed to produce binding resolutions.</li>
        <li>2035: Joint water-sharing framework between India and Pakistan briefly eased tensions in Punjab and Sindh regions.</li>
        <li>2039: BRICS+ summit in Colombo promoted “Cold Peace Doctrine” — maintained non-aggression pacts but no real reconciliation.</li>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-300 mb-2">Energy & Tech Impacts</h2>
      <p>
        Military infrastructure in the Himalayas severely disrupted green energy corridors and quantum communication grids. China expanded its BRI-linked “Pan-Eurasian Grid,” while India boosted solar AI grids across Rajasthan. Cyber warfare delayed development timelines across all parties.

    <section class="scroll-reveal">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-300 mb-2">Current Status Quo </h2>
      <p>
        South Asia remains a volatile but largely cold conflict zone. China controls strategic vantage points in Aksai Chin, while India maintains a strong military posture in Ladakh. Pakistan continues to support hybrid warfare elements in Kashmir. Diplomacy exists, but deep-rooted mistrust prevents resolution.
