      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-200 mb-2">Estimated Deaths</h2>
      <p>Between 2025 and 2040, the estimated death toll reached <span class="text-red-400 font-semibold">600,000</span>, largely due to skirmishes in disputed Himalayan regions, drone warfare over PoK, and two major escalations in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh. Civilians were affected heavily during cyber blackouts and strikes in border towns.</p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
        <li>2026: The Delhi Dialogue Framework proposed by India was dismissed by China as "territorially biased."</li>
        <li>2029: SCO-backed trilateral summit in Tashkent resulted in a fragile disengagement along the LAC.</li>
        <li>2032: The UN Digital Borders Initiative failed due to non-compliance from Pakistan regarding Kashmir data transparency.</li>
        <li>2038: A secret Beijing-Islamabad pact surfaced, heightening Indian aggression in the Siachen Glacier.</li>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-200 mb-2">Energy & Tech Impacts</h2>
      <p>All three nations invested heavily in militarized satellites, space surveillance, and hypersonic delivery systems. India's quantum communication grid was first tested in active military zones in 2035. China fortified its artificial island bases while Pakistan became a key recipient of Chinese AI defense networks.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-200 mb-2">Current Status Quo (2040)</h2>
      <p>
        India maintains military superiority in Arunachal and Ladakh, but faces encirclement via China's Belt-and-Drone corridor. Pakistan has lost conventional warfare capabilities but relies on asymmetric, AI-guided insurgency. No diplomatic resolution exists. All nations are in a cyber cold war, with global mediation attempts repeatedly stalled.
