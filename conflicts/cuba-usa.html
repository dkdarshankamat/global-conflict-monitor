      <p>While direct military confrontation has been avoided, over <span class="text-red-400 font-semibold">4,500 indirect deaths</span> occurred due to blockades, migration crises, and cyber sabotage affecting critical infrastructure and healthcare systems.</p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
 <li>1962: Cuban Missile Crisis Resolution
After near-nuclear war, U.S. and USSR agreed to withdraw missiles. U.S. pledged not to invade Cuba.</li>
 <li>1994 :U.S.–Cuba Migration Accord agreed on safer, legal migration pathways after a wave of Cuban boat people. U.S. would issue 20,000 visas yearly; Cuba would stop illegal departures</li>
 <li>2014–2016: Obama–Castro Rapprochement</li>
        <li>2026: A failed attempt at re-opening diplomatic missions post-sanctions rollback led to protests in Havana.</li>
        <li>2029: Pope Francis II hosted trilateral dialogues involving Spain and Mexico — stalled due to Cuba’s AI surveillance rollout.</li>
        <li>2033–2037: Multiple UN GA resolutions condemned US cyber interventions in Cuban communications, but no major sanctions followed.</li>
        <li>2039: A rare naval incident near Guantanamo reignited tensions, briefly putting drone defense systems on alert.</li>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-yellow-200 mb-2">Energy & Tech Impacts</h2>
      <p>Cuba developed a partnership with Brazil and China for solar microgrids, reducing dependency on US-linked fuel imports. In response, the US imposed satellite-based communication disruptions. The Caribbean Sea became a hotspot for drone surveillance and underwater cable tampering.</p>

    <section class="scroll-reveal">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-yellow-200 mb-2">Current Status Quo </h2>
      <p>
        While not an active war zone, the Cuba–USA standoff remains a Cold War 2.0 scenario. Trade restrictions persist, Havana’s alignment with China and Russia deepens, and Florida’s migrant crisis continues. Cyber hostility defines this low-intensity but geopolitically potent conflict.
