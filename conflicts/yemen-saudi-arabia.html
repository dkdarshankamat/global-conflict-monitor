      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-yellow-300 mb-2">Estimated Deaths</h2>
      <p>
        From 2025 to 2040, over <span class="text-yellow-500 font-semibold">380,000</span> people died as a result of continuing drone strikes, naval blockades, humanitarian crises, and internal clashes among militias, despite global efforts to end the war.

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
        <li>2025: The Geneva II Yemen Peace Accord collapsed after Houthi factions rejected oil-sharing terms.</li>
        <li>2029: Iran and Saudi Arabia established a joint "Observation Corridor" in Marib with limited UN presence.</li>
        <li>2033: The African Union facilitated talks in Djibouti—initially promising but later derailed due to cross-border drone attacks.</li>
        <li>2038: The “Green Crescent Pact” signed by southern Yemeni tribes offered local ceasefires, but lacked enforcement capacity.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-yellow-300 mb-2">Energy & Tech Impacts</h2>
      <p>
        Red Sea shipping routes were disrupted frequently due to drone raids and missile threats. Saudi Arabia developed high-altitude counter-drone towers, while Yemen saw a rise in decentralized solar-powered militia tech. Global oil prices spiked during the 2032 Bab el-Mandeb crisis.

    <section class="scroll-reveal">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-yellow-300 mb-2">Current Status Quo (2040)</h2>
      <p>
        Yemen remains fractured: Northern Yemen is Houthi-controlled, the South operates under a semi-autonomous alliance supported by the UAE, and the central government is exiled. Saudi Arabia maintains a fortified southern border and no-fly zones. A fragile ceasefire has held since late 2039, but trust remains low.
