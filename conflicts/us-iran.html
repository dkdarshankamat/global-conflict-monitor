      <p>
        Between 2025 and 2040, the prolonged US–Iran tensions resulted in <span class="text-red-500 font-semibold">35,000+</span> deaths. Most fatalities stemmed from proxy conflicts in Iraq and Syria, targeted drone strikes, and a brief naval clash in the Strait of Hormuz in 2032.

<li>1981: Algiers Accords ended the U.S. embassy hostage crisis.</li>
<li>2006–2013: Backchannel diplomacy through Oman set stage for nuclear talks.</li>
<li>2015: Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) limited Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.</li>
<li>2018: U.S. withdrawal from JCPOA under Trump re-escalated tensions.</li>
<li>2021–2022: Indirect Vienna talks under Biden tried to revive JCPOA, but stalled.</li>


        <li>2026: Restart of JCPOA+ negotiations failed due to disagreement over ballistic missile limitations.</li>
        <li>2029: Swiss-led talks achieved a temporary maritime non-aggression pact — broke down in 2031.</li>
        <li>2034: Oman facilitated backchannel discussions after cyberattacks on oil facilities increased instability.</li>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-300 mb-2">Energy & Tech Impacts</h2>
      <p>
        Global oil markets were destabilized multiple times due to tanker incidents in the Persian Gulf. In response, major powers accelerated their transition to alternative fuels. Iran invested in AI-based surveillance tech domestically, while the US fortified its energy cybersecurity infrastructure.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-300 mb-2">Current Status Quo </h2>
      <p>
        Diplomatic relations remain minimal, but direct conflict has been avoided since 2035. Iran maintains regional influence through its proxies, while the US leverages an expanded military and AI monitoring presence in the Gulf. Both nations continue cyber posturing and tech deterrence while avoiding direct escalation.
