      <p>Between 2025 and 2040, an estimated <span class="text-red-400 font-semibold">215,000 lives</span> have been lost due to sporadic border skirmishes, internal rebellions in South Kordofan and Blue Nile, and resource-driven conflicts in Unity State and Abyei.</p>

        <li>2025: The Juba Talks resumed but collapsed after oil-sharing disputes.</li>
        <li>2028–2030: AU-led demilitarized buffer zones reduced direct combat by 60%.</li>
        <li>2035: A joint energy corridor was proposed but sabotaged by rebel factions.</li>
        <li>2039: A tentative peace accord signed with Chinese mediation remains fragile.</li>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-300 mb-2">Energy & Tech Impacts</h2>
      <p>South Sudan’s oil fields saw increased Chinese and Indian investment. Pipelines through Ethiopia faced repeated cyberattacks. Drone surveillance by Turkey, and the deployment of Russian-built energy microstations in contested regions, shaped the modern battlefield.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-300 mb-2">Current Status Quo (2040)</h2>
      <p>
        The conflict remains unresolved. Though there are reduced large-scale battles, skirmishes persist in resource-rich regions. The border remains militarized, with both nations relying on international peacekeepers to maintain fragile ceasefires. 
        Political instability in Khartoum and Juba hampers long-term peace.
