      <p>
        Between 2025 and 2040, escalating tensions and near-military confrontations led to <span class="text-red-500 font-semibold">60,000+</span> deaths, primarily due to cyber-attacks, naval skirmishes in the Taiwan Strait, and regional missile exchanges during the 2034 crisis.

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
 <li>1992: “1992 Consensus” (informal agreement) where both sides acknowledged “One China” with different interpretations.</li>
 <li>1993: Koo–Wang Talks marked first official cross-strait dialogue.</li>
 <li>2005: Pan-Blue visit to China led to symbolic easing of party-to-party tensions.</li>
 <li>2008–2016: Cross-Strait Agreements under Taiwan's Ma Ying-jeou included direct flights, trade, and tourism deals.</li>
 <li>2015: Historic Xi–Ma Summit in Singapore marked first meeting of leaders since 1949.</li>

        <li>2026: The “Digital Firewall Agreement” attempted to curb state-sponsored cyber sabotage — partially successful but poorly enforced.</li>
        <li>2029: UN-backed talks in Singapore stalled after Taiwan reaffirmed sovereignty.</li>
        <li>2034: U.S. destroyer incident near the Kinmen Islands led to a weeklong naval confrontation; de-escalated through backchannel diplomacy in Tokyo.</li>
        <li>2038: ASEAN-led mediation created a “No-Drone” buffer zone over Taiwan Strait.</li>

      <p>
        Global semiconductor supply chains were severely disrupted from 2030 to 2035. Taiwan fast-tracked offshore AI manufacturing facilities, while China invested in quantum-resistant cyber defenses. The U.S. established “Pacific Tech Corridors” to reduce dependence on East Asian chip routes.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-300 mb-2">Current Status Quo </h2>
      <p>
        Taiwan remains de facto independent with limited international recognition. China maintains heavy military presence along its southeastern coast. The U.S. Seventh Fleet operates under expanded joint-defense protocols with Japan and Taiwan. While open war has been avoided, both sides remain locked in a high-tech cold war.
