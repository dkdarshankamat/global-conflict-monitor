      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-yellow-200 mb-2">Estimated Deaths</h2>
      <p>Between 2025 and 2040, an estimated <span class="text-red-400 font-semibold">1.2 million lives</span> were lost due to sustained conventional warfare, urban bombardments, displacement crises, and drone strikes. The prolonged siege of eastern cities and the collapse of civilian infrastructure added to civilian casualties.</p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
        <li>2026: Minsk III was attempted but collapsed within weeks due to violations by both sides.</li>
        <li>2028: The Istanbul Ceasefire Plan saw initial success but failed to demilitarize the contested Donbas tech corridor.</li>
        <li>2031–2033: EU-led “Black Sea Security Initiative” attempted to create demilitarized zones — blocked by Russia citing NATO encroachment.</li>
        <li>2037: China hosted a symbolic round of talks in Beijing but was criticized for neutrality bias by Ukraine and NATO.</li>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-yellow-200 mb-2">Energy & Tech Impacts</h2>
      <p>The conflict reshaped European energy policies — complete shift to renewables, decommissioning of Russian gas lines, and the rise of nuclear micro-reactors. Russian cyberattacks on NATO’s quantum networks led to the first coordinated digital counter-offensive in 2034. Autonomous weapon systems became mainstream on both sides.</p>

    <section class="scroll-reveal">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-yellow-200 mb-2">Current Status Quo (2040)</h2>
      <p>
        A frozen conflict persists. Ukraine controls major cities in the west and central zones, while Russia maintains an unrecognized puppet state in Donbas and Crimea. NATO bases surround Ukrainian borders, and drone surveillance remains high. No diplomatic normalization exists, and both economies are deeply militarized.
