      <p>
        Between 2025 and 2040, the Israel–Palestine conflict saw an estimated <span class="text-red-500 font-semibold">90,000+</span> deaths due to continued urban warfare, drone strikes, and intensified border clashes, especially during the 2029 Gaza escalation and the 2036 Jerusalem standoff.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-300 mb-2">Historical Peace Efforts</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
        <li>2026: The Riyadh Peace Framework was endorsed by the Arab League but rejected by key factions in Gaza and the West Bank.</li>
        <li>2030: A joint EU–U.S. mission established a short-lived demilitarized zone in Northern Gaza.</li>
        <li>2033: The Two-State Referendum initiative failed following internal divisions and violence in the West Bank.</li>
        <li>2038: The Mediterranean Accord attempted to create an economic union zone including Israel and Palestinian territories—partially successful for trade but failed politically.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-300 mb-2">Energy & Tech Impacts</h2>
      <p>
        The prolonged conflict disrupted Eastern Mediterranean gas exploration. Israeli cybersecurity firms became global leaders, while Palestinian startups emerged through diaspora funding. The 2034 cyber-conflict with Iran escalated digital surveillance across the region.

    <section class="scroll-reveal">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-300 mb-2">Current Status Quo (2040)</h2>
      <p>
        Israel maintains control over key strategic zones, while the West Bank remains fragmented between multiple authorities. Gaza, though rebuilt in parts, remains under heavy blockade. International recognition for a two-state solution is fading, replaced by smaller bilateral tech and security pacts with third-party states.
